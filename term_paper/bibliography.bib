abstract = {Automatic bug finding with static analysis requires precise tracking of different memory object values. This paper describes a mem- ory modeling method for static analysis of C programs. It is particularly suitable for precise path-sensitive analyses, e.g., symbolic execution. It can handle almost all kinds of C expressions, including arbitrary levels of pointer dereferences, pointer arithmetic, composite array and struct data types, arbitrary type casts, dynamicmemory allocation, etc. Itmaps aliased lvalue expressions to the identical object without extra alias anal- ysis. The model has been implemented in the Clang static analyzer and enhanced the analyzer a lot by enabling it to have precise value tracking ability},

abstract = {Modern supercomputers with multi-core nodes en- hanced by accelerators, as well as hybrid programming models, introduce more complexity in modern applications. Exploiting efficiently all the resources requires a complex analysis of the performance of applications in order to detect time-consuming or idle sections. This paper presents EZTRACE, a generic trace generation framework that aims at providing a simple way to analyze applications. EZTRACE is based on plugins that allow it to trace different programming models such as MPI, pthread or OpenMP as well as user-defined libraries or application. This framework uses two steps: one to collect the basic information during execution and one post-mortem analysis. This permits tracing the execution of applications with low overhead while allowing to refine the analysis after the execution of the program. We also present a simple script language for EZTRACE that gives the user the capability to easily define the functions to instrument without modifying the source code of the application. The evaluation of EZTRACE shows that the framework offers a convenient way to analyze applications without impacting the execution.},

Parallelism has become central to the efficient use of resources, and this new textbook by Peter Pacheco will go a long way toward introducing students early in their academic careers to both the art and practice of parallel computing. An Introduction to Parallel Programming illustrates fundamental programming principles in the increasingly important area of shared-memory programming using Pthreads and OpenMP and distributed-memory programming using MPI. More important, it empha-sizes good programming practices by indicating potential performance pitfalls. These topics are presented in the context of a variety of disciplines, including computer science, physics, and mathematics. The chapters include numerous programming exercises that range from easy to very challenging. This is an ideal book for students or professionals looking to learn parallel programming skills or to refresh their knowledge.},

abstract = {Parallel programming introduces new types of bugs that are notoriously difficult to find. As a result researchers have put a significant amount of effort into creating tools and techniques to discover parallel bugs. One of these bugs is the violation of the assumption of atomicity— the assumption that a region of code, called a critical section, executes without interruption from an outside operation. In this thesis, we introduce a new heuristic to infer critical sections using the temporal and spatial locality of critical sections and provide empirical results showing that the heuristic can infer critical sections in shared memory programs. Real critical sections in benchmark programs are completely covered by inferred critical sections up to 75{\%} to 80{\%} of the time. A programmer can use the reported critical sections to inform his addition of locks into the program.},

@article{Mohror2012,
abstract = {Accurate performance analysis of high end systems requires event-based traces to correctly identify the root cause of a number of the complex performance problems that arise on these highly parallel systems. These high-end architectures contain tens to hundreds of thousands of processors, pushing application scalability challenges to new heights. Unfortunately, the collection of event-based data presents scalability challenges itself: the large volume of collected data increases tool overhead, and results in data files that are difficult to store and analyze. Our solution to these problems is a new measurement technique called trace profiling that collects the information needed to diagnose performance problems that traditionally require traces, but at a greatly reduced data volume. The trace profiling technique reduces the amount of data stored by capitalizing on the repeated behavior of programs, and on the similarity of the behavior and performance of parallel processes in an application run. Trace profiling is a hybrid between profiling and tracing, collecting summary information about the event patterns in an application run. Because the data has already been classified into behavior categories, we can present reduced, partially analyzed performance data to the user, highlighting the performance behaviors that comprised most of the execution time. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In order to design parallel applications that exploit efficiently modern supercomputers with their complex architec- ture, it is required to apply a variety of programming models and techniques. The development of such applications as well as their tuning to achieve the optimal performance is practically impossible without performance analysis tools. In this paper, we present a scalable binary trace library – Lightweight Trace Library (LiTL). LiTL aims at providing performance analysis tools with a low-overhead event recording service. In order to enhance the scalability and the performance of such tools, we implement various optimization strategies and techniques in LiTL. The experiments on a suite of synthetic and standard computation kernels show that the overhead caused by LiTL in conjunction with EZTrace remains low. Furthermore, LiTL often performs better than the existing event recording libraries, saving up to 88{\%} of the CPU time and up to 68{\%} of the disk space. Finally, LiTL is a generic library that can be used in conjunction with a wide range of performance analysis tools.},
