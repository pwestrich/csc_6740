Title: 
Determining the Added Overhead of the EZTrace system

Abstract:
Large parallel processes scale to thousands of processes and threads on the largest of machines.
In order to determine unforseen performance bottlenecks, most developers turn to tracing and profiling.
Howewver, this tracing and profiling takes a toll on performance itself. In this paper, we present
measurements of the EZTrace library to determine the overhead it introduces.

Outline:
1. Introuction
	a)	Why we need HPC
	b)	What is tracing/profiling?
	c)	What is EZTrace?
	d)	Why is it important?
	e)	What makes it difficult?
2. Testing methods
	a)	Explain what methods were used to test tools in #1.c
3. Results
	a)	Explain results (tables, graphs, paragraphs)
	b)	Discuss the results
4. Conclusion
	a)	Sum it up.
