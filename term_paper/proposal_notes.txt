Notes:

- Aligning with research area is good, but can't miss class goal (what's the goal?)
- Goal: Do something with a parallel algorithm, such as benchmarking, analyzing...
- Tracing algorithm/format
- Cost of tracing (benchmark before/after)
- Comparison and benchmarking of parallel tracing implementations
-
